Tractography has recently been posed as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem [1] so as to leverage the expressiveness of
machine learning without the need for hard-to-obtain reference streamlines. Despite their competitive performances, agents trained
via this method produced a high rate of false-positive connections as well as low bundle volume compared to both classical and
machine-learning based approaches. In this work, we incorporate anatomical priors, which have been used in classical tractography,
into the Track-to-Learn framework to alleviate these shortcomings.
