Incorporating anatomical priors into Track-to-Learn	Poster	Poster-2	ISMRM Workshop on Diffusion MRI: From Research to Clinic	2022-10-04	Amsterdam, Netherlands	https://cds.ismrm.org/protected/Diffusion22/abstracts/Theberge.pdf	"Tractography has recently been posed as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem [1] so as to leverage the expressiveness of
machine learning without the need for hard-to-obtain reference streamlines. Despite their competitive performances, agents trained
via this method produced a high rate of false-positive connections as well as low bundle volume compared to both classical and
machine-learning based approaches. In this work, we incorporate anatomical priors, which have been used in classical tractography,
into the Track-to-Learn framework to alleviate these shortcomings."

The do’s and don’ts of reinforcement learning for Tractography	Poster	Poster-1	Medical Imaging with Deep Learning	2022-07-06	Zürich, Switzerland	https://2022.midl.io/papers/b_s_3	Tractography is the process of virtually reconstructing the white matter structure of the brain in a non-invasive manner. To tackle the various known problems of tractography, deep learning has been proposed, but the lack of well curated diverse datasets makes neural networks incapable of generalizing well on unseen data. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to effectively learn the tractography procedure without reference streamlines. While the performances reported were competitive, the proposed framework is complex and little is known on the role and impact of its multiple parts. In this work, we thoroughly explore the different components of the proposed framework through seven experiments on two datasets and shed light on their impact. Our goal is to guide researchers eager to explore the possibilities of deep RL for tractography by exposing what works and what does not work with this category of approach. We find that directionality is crucial for the agents to learn the tracking procedure and that the input signal and the seeding strategy offer a trade-offs in connectivity vs. Volume.

Track-To-Learn: A general framework for tractography with deep reinforcement learning	Oral	Oral-1	2021 ISMRM & SMRT Annual Meeting & Exhibition	2021-05-15	Paris, France (Online)	https://cds.ismrm.org/protected/21MPresentations/videos//0336.htm	Supervised machine learning algorithms have been proposed to learn tractography algorithms implicitly from data, without relying on hard-to-develop anatomical priors. However, supervised learning methods rely on labelled data that is very hard to obtain. To remove the need for such data but still leverage the expressiveness of neural networks, we introduce and implement Track-To-Learn, a general framework to pose tractography as a deep reinforcement learning problem. We show that competitive results can be obtained on known data and that the learned algorithms are able to generalize far better to new, unseen data, than prior supervised learning-based tractography algorithms.
